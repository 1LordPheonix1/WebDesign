			<h2>Welcome to Let's Travel The World!</h2>
			<!--<center>-->
			<p class="description">By traveling - both within the US and abroad - we<br>expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of <br>the world we live in.</p>
			<p class="description">Experiencing other cultures, including new food,<br>languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us<br>better understand our own culture.</p>
			<p class="description">We are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers<br> ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can<br>draw upon our own experiences when putting together a <br>great adventure for you and your family.</p>
			<p class="description2">Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two<br>or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map on your wall at home and get out the color<br>pushpins...</p>
			<p class="description2">So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p>
